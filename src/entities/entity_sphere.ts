/* FIXME:
 * Entities can encompass multiple octree nodes (entity sets).
 * 1st approach (complex, would provide good culling for high tree heights, but requires a lot of computation while refreshing):
 *    take two AABB-s: the interior and the exterior.
 *    Produce the interior and exterior node sets, each one including the nodes intersected by the particular AABB.
 *    Subtract the exterior and interior node sets - the resulting one roughly includes the nodes of interest.
 *
 * 2nd approach (reasonably best, but will show the main con of octrees in non-voxel related scenarios: inefficiency when object alignment is odd):
 *    refactor the octree implementation to allow adding elements at nodes themselves, not just octants and
 *    put oddly aligned/sized entities in nodes completely encompassing them.
 *
 * 3nd approach (simplest and best for the scope of the project) Keep octree implementation as-is, but enforce a proper alignment and size (one per a node) for all entities.
 *
 * 4th approach (DO NOT!): implement BVH or KD-trees.
